# Wellness-Technology-Analysis

Project Overview:

This analytical study explored user interaction patterns with a wellness application. The goal was to deduce effective strategies to promote better health engagement and ascertain features that resonate with user needs.

Date:

September 2023

Technologies Used:

Microsoft Excel: For data analysis, trend spotting, and data visualization.
Google Docs: For collaborative documentation and report collation.

Key Findings:

Daily Step Count:

Encouraging users to target 9,000 steps a day resulted in a noticeable improvement in their overall health metrics.
User Engagement on Holidays:

Users were more receptive to health prompts during holidays. Gentle nudges to maintain activity and hydration levels were effective.
Recommendations
Feature Enhancement: Introduce a dynamic step count recommendation based on a user's activity history, targeting incremental improvements.

Holiday Campaigns: Design holiday-specific wellness challenges or programs. Given the increased receptiveness, this can spur user engagement and healthier choices.

Integration with Smart Devices: Consider integrating with smart wearables to provide real-time health metrics and feedback.

Further Work:

Building upon the insights from this analysis, future directions can include:

A/B testing of new app features based on the recommendations.
Surveys to gather direct user feedback for feature refinement.

Collaborating with nutritionists or fitness trainers for expert content and guidance within the app.

Collaboration:
I am open to feedback, insights, or innovative ideas to enhance user health engagement further. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to fork this repository and propose changes through pull requests.
